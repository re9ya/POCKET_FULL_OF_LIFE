# POCKET_FULL_OF_LIFE STORY GAME
*NOTICE: THIS WEB GAME IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS*

Hello and Welcome!
    This is my game, "Pocket Full of Life"

About Me
    Thank you for looking at my web game! My name is re9ya and I am a junior in highschool. I've coded for about a year and a half and wanted to further challenge myself in making this game while also being able to show some of the values and experiences I've held onto dearly and want to show to the world. This is Pocket Full of Life!

Why did I call it the "Pocket Full of Life"?
    A "pocket full" usually carries a negative connotation—it feels small, insufficient, and never quite enough. This game centers on that void: the loss of confidence, the desperate search for external acceptance, and the tragedy of never truly living for oneself. Through this story, I want to show how expectations rise, time slips away, and isolation only grows thicker.

What does each item (the pocket, the 1/2 filled cup, the volleyball, and the planet) represent in this game?
    The Pocket
        Represents the insufficiency of time, character, and experiences. Honestly, the title for this game was random---it was the first thing that popped into my head at the time. But it also felt like it really covered everything that I wanted to achieve in making this game, so yay!(?)
    The 1/2 Filled Cup
        My dad always reminds me about this: "Do you precieve the glass as half empty or half full?" I never really knew what he meant until I dove deeper into this chaotic mess. I've always been a glass half empty (not intentionally of course). A glass half full is when the individual views a situation with optimism or hope. In comparison, a glass half empty person drowns in what is missing, leading to a sense of insufficiency or limited time.
    The Volleyball:
        I played volleyball for 5 years. I started when I was 12. I didn't think I would go that far, but I naturally grew a burning love for the sport. It was a toxic relationship though---I often had many burn-outs, mental breakdowns, and such. It's normal, until it goes too far. But nothing can ever stop me from loving the sport. It is still a major part of me, and I hope to reflect that in this game.
    The Planet---Earth:
        Another thing my dad always says: "The world is not going to wait on you. No one's going to do it for you either. Time's just going to keep ticking. Move on." Honestly, at first, I hated when he said that. I know time is running out and I'm basically rotting away. When I started my game though, I realized how important that saying was to me and I even added the element in. Time is going to keep moving and no one's going to do it for you. I realized that change is up to me if I truly want it, that no matter how many mistakes I make, no matter how many times I fall, I will be making the next steps.

Who does Tico, the main character, represent?
    While I hope Tico resonates with many, she is specifically designed to represent the struggling student-athletes who face these exact experiences. And to all of those going through something similar, just know that there are plenty of us out there and that you are never alone. A battle between you and yourself...

What does the quote in the opening mean?
    The quote, from The Great Gatsby, was told to the main character when he was very young and has stayed with him. He travels to the East, a place of wealth and parties, where he meets "careless people" who make messes and let others clean them up. He also meets Gatsby, a neighbor driven by love and obsession. The character learns Gatsby's tragic story of trying to gain wealth just to win back his lost love.
    The quote means exactly what it says: don't judge people. The quote comes from one of America's Greatest Novels, "The Great Gatsby"---a story about the spoiled rich East and a man that has an urreachable dreams. This book really stuck with me and prompted me to create this game. My game expands this: don't judge people because you never see their full story. They might be burnt out, heartbroken, or lost. You only really know after their actions are done, and by then, it's too late to change things.
