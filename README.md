# POCKET_FULL_OF_LIFE STORY GAME
I am planning to make a simple RPG/story game with html, css, and javascript! 

Hello and Welcome!
This is my game "Pocket Full of Life"

Why did I call it the "Pocket Full of Life"?
  When something is only "pocket full," it usually has a negative connotation. It sounds too small, insufficient, and/or not enough. This represents the main theme throught this game---a story of never BEING, HAVING, or EXPERIENCING enough...Through the eyes of our main character, we see how expectations run higher, time running quicker, and isolation grow thicker.

Who does Tico, the main character, represent?
  I hope my character is able to relate to many people but I hope to represent the many struggling student-athletes out there that face a similar experience...

What does the quote in the opening mean?
  This is a quote from my favorite book---The Great Gatsby---told to the main character at a very young age. The quote sticks to the protagonist even after many years. He travels to the East, which flurished in parties, treasures, and wealth during the time of the Jazz Age. He meets many aquaintances---whom he describes to be "a rotten crowd" and "careless people" who "smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money... and let other people clean up the mess they had made." While experiencing the crap of the East, he also meets a man named Gatsby, a neighbor from next door. Nick and Gatsby hang out a lot and Nick truly gets to know him---how he, a poor boy, and a girl, born into another rich family, were in love, how he went to war and found that his only love had married another (to keep her wealthy status), and how he did anything and everything to rake up some money to get to her level of wealth in order to get her back. Nick admires Gatsby's loyalty, honesty, and drive but also sees that this passion, this obsession defines Gatsby---that he is only working for the woman of his dreams...
  The quote itself means exactly what it says: don't judge people. For me, after reading this book, it goes a bit deeper---don't judge people because you never see what they're going through. They might be experiencing a burn out, some might have their dreams crushed, some might not feel like enough, and some cannot seem to find their own identity. You never really know until actions are done. There's truly no way to alter it after.
